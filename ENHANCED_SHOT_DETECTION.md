# Enhanced Shot Detection System 🎯

A comprehensive enhancement to the squash ball tracking system that provides **clear, autonomous detection** of all ball events during a match.

## 🚀 Key Features

### **Clear Event Classification**
- 🏓 **Ball hit from racket** (shot start)
- 🏢 **Ball hitting front wall** vs side walls  
- 🔄 **Ball hit by opponent's racket** (new shot start)
- ⬇️ **Ball bouncing to ground** (shot/rally end)

### **Autonomous Detection**
- Minimal manual intervention required
- Physics-based validation using velocity and direction analysis
- Multiple validation methods with confidence scoring
- Self-describing event outputs

### **Enhanced Accuracy**
- Wall type identification (front, side_left, side_right, back)
- Player assignment for racket hits
- Shot boundary tracking (start → middle → end)
- Confidence scoring for all events

## 📋 Implementation Overview

### Core Functions

#### `enhanced_shot_detection_pipeline()`
Main integration function that provides comprehensive shot analysis:

```python
enhanced_result = enhanced_shot_detection_pipeline(
    past_ball_pos, players_data, frame_count
)

# Access classified events
events = enhanced_result['autonomous_classification']
boundaries = enhanced_result['shot_boundaries'] 
confidence = enhanced_result['confidence_scores']
```

#### `detect_ball_hit_advanced()`
Enhanced ball hit detection with event classification:

```python
hit_result = detect_ball_hit_advanced(
    pastballpos, ballthreshold=8, angle_thresh=35, 
    velocity_thresh=2.5, advanced_analysis=True
)

# Returns detailed event information:
# {
#   'hit_detected': True,
#   'confidence': 0.85,
#   'hit_type': 'angle',
#   'event_type': 'racket_hit',  # NEW
#   'wall_type': 'none',         # NEW  
#   'player_proximity': 45       # NEW
# }
```

#### `count_wall_hits_enhanced()`
Detailed wall hit analysis with type classification:

```python
wall_analysis = count_wall_hits_enhanced(
    past_ball_pos, threshold=12, 
    court_width=640, court_height=360
)

# Returns comprehensive wall information:
# {
#   'total_hits': 2,
#   'front_wall_hits': 1,
#   'side_wall_hits': 1,
#   'wall_events': [
#     {
#       'frame': 52,
#       'position': (340, 20),
#       'wall_type': 'front',
#       'confidence': 0.92
#     }
#   ]
# }
```

### Supporting Functions

- **`classify_ball_event()`** - Autonomous event classification using physics
- **`detect_wall_hit_with_type()`** - Specific wall type identification  
- **`detect_shot_boundaries()`** - Shot start/middle/end detection
- **`detect_racket_hits_in_trajectory()`** - Racket hit detection with player assignment
- **`detect_ground_bounces_in_trajectory()`** - Ground bounce detection

## 🎯 Usage Examples

### Basic Usage

```python
# Replace existing detection calls
# OLD:
hit_result = detect_ball_hit_advanced(past_ball_pos, 8, 35, 2.5)
wall_hits = count_wall_hits_legacy(past_ball_pos)

# NEW:
enhanced_result = enhanced_shot_detection_pipeline(
    past_ball_pos, players_data, frame_count
)
```

### Event Processing

```python
events = enhanced_result['autonomous_classification']

# Process racket hits  
for hit in events['racket_hits']:
    print(f"🏓 {hit['description']}")
    # "Ball hit by player 1 at frame 45"

# Process wall hits
for wall_hit in events['front_wall_hits']:
    print(f"🏢 {wall_hit['description']}")  
    # "Ball hit front wall at frame 52"

# Process opponent hits
for opponent_hit in events['opponent_hits']:
    print(f"🔄 {opponent_hit['description']}")
    # "Ball hit by opponent (player 2) - new shot started at frame 78"

# Process ground bounces
for bounce in events['ground_bounces']:
    print(f"⬇️ {bounce['description']}")
    # "Ball bounced on ground at frame 95 - shot/rally ended"
```

### Shot Boundary Tracking

```python
boundaries = enhanced_result['shot_boundaries']

if boundaries['current_shot_active']:
    print(f"Shot in progress by player {boundaries['current_player']}")
    print(f"Started at frame {boundaries['shot_start_frame']}")
else:
    print("No active shot")
    if boundaries['shot_end_frame']:
        print(f"Last shot ended at frame {boundaries['shot_end_frame']}")
```

## 📊 Output Format

The enhanced system provides rich, structured output:

```
Enhanced Shot Detection Results:
├── 🏓 Ball hit by player 1 at frame 45 (confidence: 0.85)
├── 🏢 Ball hit front wall at frame 52 (confidence: 0.92) 
├── 🔄 Ball hit by opponent (player 2) at frame 78 (confidence: 0.88)
├── 🏢 Ball hit side_left wall at frame 85 (confidence: 0.75)
└── ⬇️ Ball bounced on ground at frame 95 - rally ended (confidence: 0.90)

Shot Boundaries:
├── Current shot active: No
├── Last shot start: Frame 78 (Player 2)
├── Last wall hit: Frame 85 (Side wall)
└── Last shot end: Frame 95 (Ground bounce)

Overall Confidence: 0.86 (High accuracy)
```

## 🔧 Integration

### Drop-in Replacement
The enhanced functions are designed as drop-in replacements for existing detection functions while providing much richer information.

### Backward Compatibility
Existing code will continue to work, but can be enhanced by accessing the new event classification fields.

### Minimal Changes Required
```python
# Minimal change to existing pipeline:
# Just replace the detection call and add event processing

# OLD:
if detect_ball_hit_advanced(past_ball_pos, 8, 35, 2.5)['hit_detected']:
    print("Ball hit detected")

# NEW:  
result = enhanced_shot_detection_pipeline(past_ball_pos, players, frame)
for event in result['autonomous_classification']['racket_hits']:
    print(f"🏓 {event['description']}")
```

## 🧪 Testing

Run the test suite to validate functionality:

```bash
python test_enhanced_detection.py
python demo_enhanced_detection.py
python integration_example.py
```

## 🎯 Benefits

### **Before Enhancement:**
- Basic hit detection with limited context
- Simple wall hit counts  
- Manual interpretation required
- Limited event classification

### **After Enhancement:**
- 📝 **Human-readable event descriptions**
- 🎯 **Precise event classification**
- 🏆 **High confidence autonomous detection**  
- 🔍 **Detailed shot boundary tracking**
- 🎪 **Physics-based validation**
- 🎨 **Wall type identification**
- 🎭 **Player assignment**

## 🚀 Result

**Much clearer shot detection** that autonomously identifies exactly what's happening with the ball at each moment, making squash analysis much more accurate and informative!
