add more data to the matplotlib chart about the distance from t over time; add when ball was hit(maybe as shading?), who hit, what kind of shot, etc.
pixel 2d coords to 3d meter coords by using court as refrence point, working with angles and all
player detection even through occlusion
finding false positives with the ball(where it goes too often?)
better shot detection
