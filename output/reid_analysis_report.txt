ENHANCED PLAYER RE-IDENTIFICATION REPORT
=======================================

Total Track ID Swaps Detected: 0
Player 1 Initialization: Complete
Player 2 Initialization: Complete

Reference Feature Counts:
- Player 1: 21 appearance features
- Player 2: 21 appearance features

Final Track Mappings: {1: 1, 5: 2}

System Performance:
- Initialization frames: 100-150 (when players are separated)
- Proximity threshold: 100 pixels (for swap detection)
- Confidence threshold: 0.6 (for identity assignments)
- Feature extraction: ResNet50-based deep features

The ReID system continuously monitors player appearances and positions,
detecting when track IDs may have been swapped due to occlusion or
close proximity between players.
