However, I can provide general guidelines on what to look for in a movement efficiency analysis:\n\n*   **Distance covered**: A well-rounded player should cover at least 20-25 meters per minute.\n*     **Speed and acceleration**: Players should be able to accelerate quickly and decelerate efficiently to change direction.\n*   **Change of direction**: The player should be able to change direction smoothly, using 45-degree cuts and shuffling movements.\n\n**Court Coverage Assessment**\n\nGiven the empty statistics, I'll outline the key aspects of court coverage:\n\n*   **Zone coverage**: Players should cover the entire court, focusing on the center and back corners.\n*   **Footwork patterns**: Players should be able to execute various footwork patterns, such as forward, lateral, and backward movements.\n*   **Vision and anticipation**: Players should be able to read the game and anticipate their opponent's next move.\n\n**Positioning Recommendations**\n\nBased on the court dimensions, I recommend the following positioning:\n\n*   **Forehand side**:",
