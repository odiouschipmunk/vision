üéæ AUTONOMOUS SQUASH COACHING ANALYSIS
============================================================

 AI COACHING INSIGHTS:
matics

 DETAILED TECHNICAL ANALYSIS:
‚Ä¢ ‚ö†Ô∏è Limited shot variety detected - practice different shot types
‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ Good rally balance between players
‚Ä¢ üìç Limited court coverage - work on court movement
‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ Good shot control with minimal wall bounces

 PERFORMANCE BENCHMARKING:
‚Ä¢ ‚ö†Ô∏è Activity rate: Low - increase match intensity

 IMMEDIATE ACTION ITEMS:
‚Ä¢ Practice different shot types (drives, drops, lobs)
‚Ä¢ Improve ball tracking and consistency

 PROGRESS TRACKING RECOMMENDATIONS:
‚Ä¢ Track shot accuracy over time
‚Ä¢ Monitor court coverage improvements
‚Ä¢ Record rally length progression
‚Ä¢ Analyze bounce pattern consistency
‚Ä¢ Current session: 20 shots analyzed
