**Enhanced Coaching Advice:**

### 1. Technical Shot Analysis with Bounce Pattern Insights

#### **Shot Placement and Bounce Control**
- **Slight Crosscourt Lob Soft:** This shot is a strong asset but can be improved in terms of placement and consistency. Analyze the bounce patterns to understand how the ball lands after being lobbed. The ball should ideally land softly and close to the net, allowing for quick follow-throughs and returns.

#### **Court Coverage and Movement Quality**

- **Ball Bounce Control:** Work on controlling the bounce of your shots. Use a rebounder or a partner to hit balls from various angles and
